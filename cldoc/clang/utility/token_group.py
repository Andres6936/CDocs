    Tokens are allocated from libclang in chunks. They must be disposed of as a
    collective group.

    One purpose of this class is for instances to represent groups of allocated
    tokens. Each token in a group contains a reference back to an instance of
    this class. When all tokens from a group are garbage collected, it allows
    this class to be garbage collected. When this class is garbage collected,
    it calls the libclang destructor which invalidates all tokens in the group.

    You should not instantiate this class outside of this module.
