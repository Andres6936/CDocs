Clang Indexing Library Bindings
===============================

This module provides an interface to the Clang indexing library. It is a
low-level interface to the indexing library which attempts to match the Clang
API directly while also being "pythonic". Notable differences from the C API
are:

 * string results are returned as Python strings, not CXString objects.

 * null cursors are translated to None.

 * access to child cursors is done via iteration, not visitation.

The major indexing objects are:

  Index

    The top-level object which manages some global library state.

  TranslationUnit

    High-level object encapsulating the AST for a single translation unit. These
    can be loaded from cldoc.ast files or parsed on the fly.

  Cursor

    Generic object for representing a node in the AST.

  SourceRange, SourceLocation, and File

    Objects representing information about the input source.

Most object information is exposed using properties, when the underlying API
call is efficient.
"""

# TODO
# ====
#
# o API support for invalid translation units. Currently we can't even get the
#   diagnostics on failure because they refer to locations in an object that
#   will have been invalidated.
#
# o fix memory management issues (currently client must hold on to index and
#   translation unit, or risk crashes).
#
# o expose code completion APIs.
#
# o cleanup ctypes wrapping, would be nice to separate the ctypes details more
#   clearly, and hide from the external interface (i.e., help(cindex)).
#
# o implement additional SourceLocation, SourceRange, and File methods.
